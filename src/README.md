# Breakxit: Sequential Memory Preserving Approach for Few-Shot Image Classification

## Installation

This repo was tested with Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS, Python 3.5, PyTorch 0.4.0, and CUDA 9.0. However, it should be compatible with recent PyTorch versions >=0.4.0

## Download Data
The data we used here is preprocessed by the repo of [MetaOptNet](https://github.com/kjunelee/MetaOptNet), but we have
renamed the file. Our version of data can be downloaded from here:

## Pre-trained Models
To directly run the evaluation, download the following weights.

[[GoogleDrive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/129plXCS6r9XRQvDlm64bDlgpxX4i6txW?usp=sharing)

Create a folder named 'models_pretrained' and put the weights there followed by mentioning that path as user input of weights when running from scripts/run.sh.
## Running

Exemplar commands for running the code can be found in `scripts/run.sh`.
